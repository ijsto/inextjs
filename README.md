## About

NextJS is a framework that makes it easy to create Universal web apps in React.

With Next.js, React pages are automatically rendered on both client and server side, without the hassle of setting up dependancies like webpack or babel and with automatic routing.

This is a simple starter project that demonstrates how to use NextJS with custom layout and some modular styles via `<style jsx />` and `<style global jsx />` tags.
